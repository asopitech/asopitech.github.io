## About Me

Hello! I'm a full-stack engineer with over 20 years of development experience. From enterprise systems to cloud infrastructure and cutting-edge AI technologies, I explore a wide range of technical domains. Whether it's designing programming languages, implementing GraphRAG systems, or building multi-cloud environments, I share my knowledge through open-source projects and technical writing.

### What I Do

- 🔬 **Research & Development** - Experimenting with AI/LLM technologies, graph databases, and modern web frameworks
- ☁️ **Cloud Infrastructure** - Building infrastructure on AWS/Azure/GCP, implementing IaC with Terraform/CDK
- 🛠️ **Open Source** - Contributing to and developing various projects in Java, TypeScript, Rust, Python, and more
- ✍️ **Tech Writing** - Sharing insights through Zenn and my personal blog
- 🌐 **Community** - Managing organizations like Project JV-lang and HC-GraphRAG

## 🌟 Featured Project

### 💎 jv [/jawa/] - Java Syntactic Sugar

**A new programming language that adds syntactic sugar to Java and transpiles to pure Java**

JV-lang is an innovative programming language targeting Java 25. It dramatically improves developer productivity and code readability while maintaining "purity" with zero runtime dependencies and zero hidden magic.

#### Key Features

- **🎯 Pure Java Output** - Transpiles to standard Java. Fully compatible with existing Java ecosystem
- **⚡ Type Inference & Null Safety** - Reduces verbose type declarations and improves safety
- **📐 Unit System** - Type-level support for currency, physical quantities, and temperature units
- **🧪 Testing Integration** - Seamless integration with JUnit, Testcontainers, and Playwright. 90-95% code reduction
- **🦀 Rust Implementation** - Fast and safe compiler implemented in Rust
- **🔧 LSP Support** - Modern development environment with Language Server Protocol support

#### Why JV-lang?

- ✅ **Zero Runtime Dependencies** - Can be gradually introduced into existing Java projects
- ✅ **Human-Friendly** - Readable and writable syntax
- ✅ **Type Safety** - Catches many errors at compile time
- ✅ **Legacy Migration** - Gradually modernize existing Java codebases
